## Overview

### Introduction

*Data Leakage Threat Response Solution Pack* is designed to provide a set of investigation and utility playbooks to respond to data leakage.

Configure Cloud Access Security Broker(CASB) connector such as Symantec CloudSOC to capture events of policy violation like 'External File Sharing'. It creates an alert of type 'Data Leakage', and then triggers a response workflow.

Refer to Simulation Scenarios - Data Leakage to experience the use case without CASB configuration

### Usage

This Solution Pack ships with the following simulation scenarios. [Refer](https://github.com/fortinet-fortisoar/solution-pack-soc-simulator/blob/develop/docs/solution-pack-guide.md) to Simulate Scenario documentation to understand how to Simulate and Reset Scenario.

#### 1. Scenario: Data Leakage

The scenario generates a demo alert of Type 'Data Leakage'.

Goto generated alert and observe the following:

- Reported information (policy violation action/description, violators username) is presented for analyzing the case
- Recommendation from CloudSOC

**Investigate Data Leakage Alert (Symantec CloudSOC)**: Launch the `Investigate Data Leakage Alert (Symantec CloudSOC)` playbook and observe various investigation activities such as

- Identify employee watchlist status of user involved in data leakage
- Identify if the file involved is a sensitive document
- Initiate containment actions for sensitive document
- Block the user in Microsoft Active Directory and using Symantec DLP investigate if the user involved in any other DLP(Data Leakage Policy) event
